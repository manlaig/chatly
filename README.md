This app was my practice to learn making Android apps with a database and an authentication.

It is created using Firebase's Realtime Database, Storage, and Authentication features.

When you launch the app, it displays a sign-in screen (if you aren't already signed in) and gives you three options to sign in (email, phone, google).

After signing in, the messages you type gets stored in the Database and it is displayed for all users.

If you send a photo, the photo gets stored in the Storage, then sent to the Database and displayed on the screen.
